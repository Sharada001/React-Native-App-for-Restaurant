Native Mobile App for a Restaurant

This Mobile Application was developed to allow customers to log into the App and search for their favaurite food items available in the restaurant, online.

✪  Automatic adjustment of Text Inputs whenever the keyboard is displayed so that user doesn't experience any interruption during typing text.
✪  Changing colors of Button components, based on continuous checking of validity of inputs provided by user, which guides user not to have any doubt on typed details.
✪  Use of AsyncStorage to persist login details of user and navigate him to relevant screens based on Authentication.
✪  Use of SQLite database to store details of food items available in the restaurant and update database by making  API calls.
✪  All storage management tasks were done via asynchronous calls to prevent any interruption to user.
✪  Search Bar and category selection components that help user to find out their favourite food or category item in no time.

Brand Style Guide provided by the restaurant was used in designing and styling, with the purpose of building up brand recognition and trust among App users.
